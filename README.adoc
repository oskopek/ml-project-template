= ml-project-template

An template for ML projects striking a balance between reproducibility and rapid iteration

== Requirements and versions:

* Python 3.5
* Git
* Tensorflow 1.5

**Important:** When commiting, remember to be *in* the virtual environment, for hooks to work.

Note: Collab still runs on different versions of everything, but this should be a good approximation (2018/02/27).

== Setup

Make sure there is no `venv/` directory in your repo. If there is, remove it.
Run the following commands:
```
./setup/create_venv.sh
source venv/bin/activate
./setup/setup_venv.sh
```

== Starting the notebook server

Run: `jupyter notebook .` in the project root directory.

=== Tensorboard

To run Tensorboard in the notebook server, go to the specified log directory, and select New > Tensorboard. A pop-up window will open (make sure to enable those in your browser).
