= Google Drive Notebook Replacement Script

To initialize for your folder and user account, create a file called `folderId.txt` with the contents being one line
that contains the id of your folder on Google Drive. The id is the last part of the URL when you open that folder
in Google Drive in your browser (the weird hash-like string).

Also authenticate your application for access to user data at the link: https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=drive
Download the json file and place it in this directory, in a file called `client_secret.json`.

Both of these files are Git-ignored on purpose, *do not commit them*!
